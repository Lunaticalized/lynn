\section{Experiments} \label{sec:experiment}

The performance is evaluated by the averaged Jaccard score. The Jaccard score between two sentences $s_1$ and $s_2$, both represented by an array of words, is defined as $$score(s_1, s_2) = \frac{|s_1 \cap s_2|}{|s_1 \cup s_2|}.$$ The test set contains 3,534 tweets samples.

Our experiment on the Kaggle dataset initially achieved an averaged Jaccard score of 0.491, using our model presented in Section~\ref{sec:model}. We later improved the model with the following preprocessing and tweeks:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Preprocess all tweets such that all urls, links and @ references are removed from the training set; and
	\item For tweets with neutral sentiments, we simply return the entire string.  
\end{itemize}

The averaged Jaccard score is improved to 0.564.
 
We are also constructing a model in which we train two separate models on the positive sentiments and the negative sentiments respectively, and then apply the corresponding trained model based on the test sample sentiment. This results in a 0.559, slightly worse than our previous approach.
